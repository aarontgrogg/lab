                    <pre>
// first step is to switch back to the main branch
git checkout master
// then merge the branch with master
git merge new-branch-name
// as long as the master has not changed since the branch was created, git performs a "fast-forward" merge, just combing the two branches and "pushing the pointer forward"
// if the master DOES have changes of its own, git does a three-way merge:
// 1) new branch into common ancestor
// 2) main into common ancestor
// 3) common ancestor back into main
// this is called a "merge commit"

// once a branch has been merged back into main, it should be deleted
git branch -d new-branch-name

// again, first step is to switch back to the main branch
git checkout master
// then rebase the branch with master
git rebase new-branch-name
// but the rebase process is a bit different from merge:
// 1) remove all commits from main branch since common ancestor split
// 2) merges new branch into master branch
// 3) commits from step 1 are reintegrated
// this gives the main branch a more linear appearance, as if all dev had happened in a single line

// Note:
// - rebase completely rewrites the commit history of a branch,
// - this can cause major conflicts if the former main branch had already been shared,
// - because someone else's branch could be based on that old branch...
// - so NEVER rebase on anything that has already been shared,
// - use ONLY for cleaning up local commits BEFORE sharing.
