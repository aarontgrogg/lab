            <h2>Why performance matters?</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Varying device capabilities, screen sizes, network speeds
                </li>
                <li>
                    Speed improves UX, search results, and accessibility, as users with poor connection speed can finally access and consume your content
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Metrics</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    How do we define "fast", or "loaded"?
                </li>
                <li>
                    UX performance:<br>
                    1) Is anything happening?<br>
                    2) Is it useful?<br>
                    3) Is it usable?
                </li>
                <li>
                    TTFB (Time to First Byte): Time between requesting page and getting first bits
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Bandwidth is no longer usually the problem; it is usually latency; even at near light speed, it takes time to travel around the world
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Server time also affects TTFB; static is fastest, dynamic is slower
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Remember the above is "per request"; 3rd party, etc.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): When the primary imagery becomes visible to the user
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            CSS, JS files, custom font files, large images, can all slow LCP
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Remember, each asset can request additional assets, creating a snowball effect
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    TTI (Time to Interactive): When the user can finally interact with the UI
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            HTML has been downloaded, elements are shown, but necessary JS is not ready yet, so even though the user can *see* something, they cannot use it
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Again, speed of download and processing affects this
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fully Loaded: Once all assets have been fully downloaded
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Many assets continue to download, even after the TTFB, LCP, FID and TTI
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A goal is a target that you set and work toward, such as "TTFB should be under 300ms" or "LCP should be under 2s"
                </li>
                <li>
                    A budget is a limit you set and try to stay undeer, such as "no more than 200kb of JS per page" or "hero image must be under 100kb"
                </li>
                <li>
                    How to choose goals?

                        <li>
                            Might want to compare against competition, or look for statistics / best practices

                </li>
                <li>
                    How to create budgets?
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Similar to goals, can compare against competition or research stats, or look for problem areas and set limits to control them
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For existing projects, starting budget can be "no worse than it is right now"...
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For new sites, can still create "talking points" for a team, to help set limits on a project
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Budgets can change as the site changes; Reach a new goal? Adjust budget to reflect that
                        </li>

                </li>

                            No way to make CSS async, but files with `media="print"` *do* load async, so can kind of abuse that:
                            <pre>&link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" media="print" onload="this.media='all'"></pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add critical CSS in-page, load full CSS later.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Can also break CSS into sections, so that Home Page-specific CSS is only loaded on that page, Contact Us-specific CSS only on that page, etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Or split CSS based on `@media` queries. Makes use of the same `media` trick above: even if not needed right now, will still download, but async, then will be ready if it is needed later.

                            Can use the `link` element to tell the browser "you will need this soon, so try to download it as soon as you can":
<pre>
&lt;head>
    ...
    &lt;link rel="preload" href="style.css" as="style">
    &lt;link rel="preload" href="main.js" as="script">

    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
    ...
    &lt;script src="main.js" defer>&lt;/script>
&lt;/body>
</pre>
                            Note you can preload several types of files, all via the `link` element, the `rel` should be "preload", the `href` is the URL, and it also needs an `as` attribute; a `type` attribute is also acceptable for things like MIME types.
<pre>
&lt;link rel="preload" href="video.mp4" as="video" type="video/mp4">
</pre>
                            Can also include a `crossorigin` for CORS:
<pre>

</pre>
                            And `media` attributes:
<pre>
&lt;link rel="preload" href="image-big.png" as="image" media="(min-width: 600px)">
</pre>
                            Similar `rel` values include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>

                            Pre-/fetch assets as quickly as possible. Similar to the "pre"s above, `preconnect` pre-fetches that connection (DNS, etc.)
<pre>
&lt;link rel="preconnect" href="https://www.google.com">

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Size images properly. Be sure to use `width` and `height` attributes as `aspect-ratio` hints to the browser, then can use CSS to make it responsive:
<pre>
&lt;img src="/image.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt=""/>
</pre>
                            Can also use `srcset` and `sizes` to offer multiple image sizes in the same `img` element. The browser will determine which makes the most sense based on the environment:
<pre>
&lt;img src="/image-sm.jpg" 
    srcset="/image-sm.jpg 300w, /image-lg.jpg 800w"
    sizes="100vw (max-width: 500px), 50vw"
    width="300" height="200" alt=""
/>
</pre>
                            Can do similar stuff using the `picture` element, but with greater control, forcing which image size is used on which screen size, or different crops for different screens, or even which image format is offered.
                            <aside>
                                Data-URIs *can* be good, but typically bloat the page, prevent caching, and delay the rendering of the content below it.
                            </aside>
                            Lazy loading is a huge help, either via a library or just using <code>loading="lazy"</code> inside the `img` element.<br>
                            For `video` elements, be sure to add <code>preload="none"</code>, really important for performance, can offer multiple <code>source></code> elements, in order of preference, and add a <code>poster</code> attribute:
<pre>
&lt;video controls playsinline poster="poster.jpg" preload="none">
    &lt;source src="video.webm" type="video/webm">
    &lt;source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4m">
&lt;/video>
</pre>
                            <code>source</code> elements can also have `media` attributes to offer different size videos for different screen sizes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Progressively load fonts. Mobile browsers will typically wait 3s, hoping the desired font is ready before showing the text.<br>
                            <code>font-display: swap</code> allows us to show the backup font stack until the font arrives, then it will *swap*...<br>
                            Some logic for using JS to load fonts include: using a Promise to fetch, load and re-paint multiple font faces at the same time; checking the user preference for data saving; checking the effective connection speed before downloading.
